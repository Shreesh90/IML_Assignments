A 6 star experience.We've just spent the past couple of days staying at the Shangri La Eros and wow!From the minute you walk into the hotel you know you've arrived somewhere special. The staff were all wonderful and so very helpful. The were attentive and always extremely helpful. Our concierge Manish Kumar was wonderful and so helpful no matter what the request. The room we had was immaculate and very well appointed.The food in ALL of the restaurants was absolutely fantastic. We're big on food and coming from Melbourne Australia we are used to the best there is, the restaurants at the Shangri La blew us away and we throughly enjoy everything we ate. We travel quite a bit all over the world and have stayed in many 5 & 6 star hotels and the Shangri La Eros didn't disappoint. Seriously an amazing hotel and we'll definitely be back.Show less","Dimple: ‚ÄúThe room ( Deluxe Kind room) was cosy and quite The bed and the temperature of the AC in the room was perfect and the Breakfast was DELICIOUS.
